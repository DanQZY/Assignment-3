Reflection on Assignment 3 (ACADEMIC WRITING on industry talk 2):
The industry talk give us some suggestions and advice on how to prepare our self before starting our career.This talk reinforced my understanding that succeeding in the field of Computer Science and IT requires a combination of technical, soft, and practical skills. It also motivated me to take a proactive approach to learning by exploring projects and certifications outside the classroom.

The industry talk was a powerful reminder of the importance of aligning academic efforts with industry needs. It inspired me to focus on becoming not just a graduate with technical knowledge but a well-rounded individual ready to contribute effectively in the tech world.
